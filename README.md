Description
===========

Installs and configures PostgreSQL as a client or a server.

Requirements
============

## Platforms

* Debian, Ubuntu
* Red Hat/CentOS/Scientific (6.0+ required) - "EL6-family"
* Fedora
* SUSE

Tested on:

* Ubuntu 10.04, 11.10, 12.04
* Red Hat 6.1, Scientific 6.1, CentOS 6.3

## Cookboooks

Requires Opscode's `openssl` cookbook for secure password generation.

Requires a C compiler and development headers in order to build the
`pg` RubyGem to provide Ruby bindings in the `ruby` recipe.

Opscode's `build-essential` cookbook provides this functionality on
Debian, Ubuntu, and EL6-family.

While not required, Opscode's `database` cookbook contains resources
and providers that can interact with a PostgreSQL database. This
cookbook is a dependency of database.

Attributes
==========

The following attributes are set based on the platform, see the
`attributes/default.rb` file for default values.

* `node['postgresql']['version']` - version of postgresql to manage
* `node['postgresql']['dir']` - home directory of where postgresql
  data and configuration lives.

* `node['postgresql']['client']['packages']` - An array of package names
  that should be installed on "client" systems.
* `node['postgresql']['server']['packages']` - An array of package names
  that should be installed on "server" systems.

The following attributes are set for all platforms, see the
`attributes/default.rb` file for default values.

 * `node['postgresql']['hba_conf']` - An array of the hba_conf entries
 to include. Each entry is a map with keys: `:type`,`:database`,
 `:user`, `:address`, `:method`.
 For example `{:type => 'host' , :database => 'all', :user => 'all',
 :address => '127.0.0.1/32' , :method => 'md5'}`

The following attributes are generated in
`recipe[postgresql::server]`.

* `node['postgresql']['password']['postgres']` - randomly generated
  password by the `openssl` cookbook's library.
* `node['postgresql']['ssl']` - whether to enable SSL (off for version
  8.3, true for 8.4).

Recipes
=======

default
-------

Includes the client recipe.

client
------

Installs postgresql client packages and development headers during the
compile phase. Also installs the `pg` Ruby gem during the compile
phase so it can be made available for the `database` cookbook's
resources, providers and libraries.

ruby
----

**NOTE** This recipe may not currently work when installing Chef with
  the
  ["Omnibus" full stack installer](http://opscode.com/chef/install) on
  some platforms due to an incompatibility with OpenSSL. See
  [COOK-1406](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1406)

Install the `pg` gem under Chef's Ruby environment so it can be used
in other recipes.

server
------

Includes the `server_debian` or `server_redhat` recipe to get the
appropriate server packages installed and service managed. Also
manages the configuration for the server:

* generates a strong default password (via `openssl`) for `postgres`
* sets the password for postgres
* manages the `pg_hba.conf` file.

server\_debian
--------------

Installs the postgresql server packages, manages the postgresql
service and the postgresql.conf file.

server\_redhat
--------------

Manages the postgres user and group (with UID/GID 26, per RHEL package
conventions), installs the postgresql server packages, initializes the
database and manages the postgresql service, and manages the
postgresql.conf file.

Resources/Providers
===================

See the [database](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/database)
for resources and providers that can be used for managing PostgreSQL
users and databases.

Usage
=====

On systems that need to connect to a PostgreSQL database, add to a run
list `recipe[postgresql]` or `recipe[postgresql::client]`.

On systems that should be PostgreSQL servers, use
`recipe[postgresql::server]` on a run list. This recipe does set a
password and expect to use it. It performs a node.save when Chef is
not running in `solo` mode. If you're using `chef-solo`, you'll need
to set the attribute `node['postgresql']['password']['postgres']` in
your node's `json_attribs` file or in a role.
